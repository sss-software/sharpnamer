# SharpNamer
A C# renaming extension for Visual Studio 2013 and above.

This is a personal side project aiming to provide some variable and paramenter names intellisense like that of ReSharper, without the memory bloat of using the latter.

## Roadmap
Since it's my first time working with [Roslyn API](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn), I will be adding simple features one by one as I adquire experience with the SDK.
In the meantine, these will be the initial features I'll be working on:
- [ ] Suggest variable names
- [ ] Suggest name based on modifiers
- [ ] Rename variable refactorings
- [ ] Append word(s) to already typed variable

Later on, I'll be adding a proper roadmap as I find useful features to add.
